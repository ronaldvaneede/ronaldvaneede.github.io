If you are a software developer or web developer you have to keep up to speed with all kind of new developments.
One good resource for that are podcasts. I spend about 2 hours a day in my car traveling to and from work, so that is a good time to catch up by listening to a podcast.

Here is a list of some podcasts that I follow and find interesting.

**The Laravel Podcast ([http://www.laravelpodcast.com](http://www.laravelpodcast.com))**

_Average episode length: 35 minutes_  
News and discussions about Laravel and PHP development by Matt Stauffer, Taylor Otwell and Jeffrey Way.

**Dev Discussions ([http://www.devdiscussions.com](http://www.devdiscussions.com))**

_Average episode length: 1 hour_

**Full Stack Radio ([http://www.fullstackradio.com](http://www.fullstackradio.com))**

**Software Engineering Radio ([http://www.se-radio.net](http://www.se-radio.net))**

The goal of this podcast is to be an educational resource, not a newscast.
A episode covers all topics related to software engineering. Either tutorials on a specific topic, or an interview with a well-known expert from the software engineering world.
